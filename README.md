The `tfswitch` command line tool lets you switch between different versions of [terraform](https://www.terraform.io/). 
If you do not have a particular version of terraform installed, `tfswitch` will download the version you desire.
The installation is minimal and easy. 
Once installed, simply select the version you require from the dropdown and start using terraform. 

See installation guide here: [tfswitch installation](https://warrensbox.github.io/terraform-switcher/)
